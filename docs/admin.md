# Administrator Guide

## Backstage Operator configuration

### Context

As it is described in Design doc (TODO), Backstage CR's desired state is defined using layered configuration approach, which means:
- By default each newly created Backstage CR uses Operator scope Default Configuration
- Which can be fully or partially overriden for particular CR instance using ConfigMap with the name pointed in BackstageCR.spec.RawConfig 
- Which in turn can be customized by other BackstageCR.spec fields (see Backstage API doc)

Cluster Administrator may want to customize Default Configuration due to internal preferences/limitations, for example:
- Preferences/restrictions for Backstage and|or PostgreSQL images due to  Airgapped environment.
- Existed Taints and Tolerations policy, so Backstage Pods have to be configured with certain tolerations restrictions.
- ...

Default Configuration is implemented as a ConfigMap called *backstage-default-config*, deployed on *backstage-system* namespace and mounted to Backstage controller container as a */default-config* directory.
This config map contains the set of keys/values which maps to file names/contents in the */default-config*.
These files contain yaml manifests of objects used by Backstage controller as an initial desired state of Backstage CR according to Backstage Operator configuration model:

Mapping of configMap keys (yaml files) to runtime objects (NOTE: for the time (Dec 20'23) it is a subject of change):

NOTES: 
 - Mandatory means it is needed to be present in either (or both) Default and CR Raw Configuration.
 - dynamic-plugins.yaml is a fragment of app-config.yaml provided with RHDH, which is mounted into a dedicated initContainer. 
 - items marked as version 0.0.1 are not supported in version 0.0.2 
### Operator Bundle configuration 

With Backstage Operator's Makefile you can generate bundle descriptor using *make bundle* command

Along with CSV manifest it generates default-config ConfigMap manifest, which can be modified and applied to Backstage Operator.

[//]: # (TODO: document how an administrator can make changes to the default operator configuration, using their own configuration file (perhaps based on the generated one), and apply it using `kubectl` or `oc`.

### Kustomize deploy configuration

Make sure use the current context in your kubeconfig file is pointed to correct place, change necessary part of your config/manager/default-config or just replace some of the file(s) with yours and run
``
make deploy
``

### Direct ConfigMap configuration

You can change default configuration by directly changing the default-config ConfigMap with kubectl like:

 - retrieve the current `default-config` from the cluster

``
kubectl get -n backstage-system configmap default-config > my-config.yaml
``

- modify the file in your editor of choice

- apply the updated configuration to your cluster

``
  kubectl apply -n backstage-system -f my-config.yaml
``

It has to be re-applied to the controller's container after being reconciled by kubernetes processes.

### Recommended Namespace for Operator Installation
It is recommended to deploy the Backstage Operator in a dedicated default namespace `backstage-system`. The cluster administrator can restrict access to the operator resources through RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings. On OpenShift, you can choose to deploy the operator in the `openshift-operators` namespace instead. However, you should keep in mind that the Backstage Operator shares the namespace with other operators and therefore any users who can create workloads in that namespace can get their privileges escalated from all operators' service accounts.

### Use Cases

#### Airgapped environment

When creating the Backstage CR, the Operator will try to create a Backstage Pod, deploying:
- Backstage Container from the image, configured in *(deployment.yaml).spec.template.spec.Containers[].image*
- Init Container (applied for RHDH configuration, usually the same as Backstage Container)

Also, if Backstage CR configured with *EnabledLocalDb*,  it will create a PostgreSQL container pod, configured in *(db-deployment.yaml).spec.template.spec.Containers[].image*

By default, the Backstage Operator is configured to use publicly available images.
If you plan to deploy to a [restricted environment](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.html),
you will need to configure your cluster or network to allow these images to be pulled.
For the list of related images deployed by the Operator, see the `RELATED_IMAGE_*` env vars or `relatedImages` section of the [CSV](../bundle/manifests/backstage-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml).
See also https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.html

#### Custom Backstage Image

You can use the Backstage Operator to deploy a backstage application with your custom backstage image by setting the field `spec.application.image` in your Backstage CR. This is at your own risk and it is your responsibility to ensure that the image is from trusted sources, and has been tested and validated for security compliance.
