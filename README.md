# Backstage Operator

## The Goal
The Goal of [Backstage](https://backstage.io) Operator project is creating Kubernetes Operator for configuring, installing and synchronizing Backstage instance on Kubernetes/OpenShift. 
The initial target is in support of Red Hat's assemblies of Backstage - specifically supporting [dynamic-plugins](https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-showcase/blob/main/showcase-docs/dynamic-plugins.md)) on OpenShift. This includes [Janus-IDP](https://janus-idp.io/) and [Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)](https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh) but may be flexible enough to install any compatible Backstage instance on Kubernetes. See additional information under [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)).
The Operator provides clear and flexible configuration options to satisfy a wide range of expectations, from "no  configuration for default quick start" to "highly customized configuration for production".

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. You can use [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) or [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) for local testing, or deploy to a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

To test it on minikube from the source code:

Both **kubectl** and **minikube** must be installed. See [tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

1.  Get your copy of Operator from GitHub: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/janus-idp/operator
```
2. Deploy Operator on the minikube cluster:
```sh
cd <your-janus-idp-operator-project-dir>
make deploy
```
you can check if the Operator pod is up by running 
```sh
kubectl get pods -n backstage-system
It should be something like:
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
backstage-controller-manager-cfc44bdfd-xzk8g   2/2     Running   0          32s
```
3. Create Backstage Custom resource on some namespace (make sure this namespace exists)
```sh
kubectl -n <your-namespace> apply -f examples/bs1.yaml
```
you can check if the Operand pods are up by running
```sh
kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace>
It should be something like:
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
backstage-85fc4657b5-lqk6r   1/1     Running   0          78s
backstage-psql-bs1-0         1/1     Running   0          79s

```
4. Tunnel Backstage Service and get URL for access Backstage
```sh
minikube service -n <your-namespace> backstage --url
Output:
>http://127.0.0.1:53245
```
5. Access your Backstage instance in your browser using this URL.
