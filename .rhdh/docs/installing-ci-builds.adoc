== Installing CI builds of Red Hat Developer Hub

WARNING: The procedure below will not work properly on OpenShift clusters with hosted control planes, like link:https://hypershift-docs.netlify.app/[HyperShift] or link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openshift-service-aws-hosted-control-planes-now-available[ROSA with hosted control planes]. This is due to a limitation preventing link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/rest_api/operator_apis/imagecontentsourcepolicy-operator-openshift-io-v1alpha1.html[`ImageContentSourcePolicy`] resources from being propagated to the cluster nodes. There is currently no workaround for these clusters.

*Prerequisites*

* You are logged in as an administrator on the OpenShift web console.
* You have configured the appropriate roles and permissions within your project to create an application. See the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/applications/index.html[Red Hat OpenShift documentation on Building applications] for more details.

*Procedure*

. Run the link:../scripts/install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh[installation script] to create the RHDH Operator CatalogSource in your cluster. By default, it installs the Release Candidate or GA version (from the `1.yy.x` branch), but the `--next` option allows to install the current development build (from the `main` branch). For example:
+
[source,console]
----
cd /tmp
curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janus-idp/operator/main/.rhdh/scripts/install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh
chmod +x install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh

# install catalog source and operator subscription, for the latest stable RC or GA from 1.yy.x branch
./install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh --latest --install-operator rhdh  

# OR, install catalog source and operator subscription, for the next CI build from main branch
./install-rhdh-catalog-source.sh --next --install-operator rhdh  
----

. If you did not create a subscription in the previous step, you can do so now. In the *Administrator* perspective of the OpenShift web console, go to *Operators* → *OperatorHub*, search for Red Hat Developer Hub, and install the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator.
