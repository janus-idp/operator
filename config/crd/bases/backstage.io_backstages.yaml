                  be mounted inside the main application container under a dedicated
                  directory containing the ConfigMap or Secret name. Additionally,
                  each file will be passed as a `--config /path/to/secret_or_configmap/key`
                  to the main container args in the order of the entries defined in
                  the AppConfigs list. But bear in mind that for a single AppConfig
                  element containing several files, the order in which those files
                  will be appended to the container args, the main container args
                  cannot be guaranteed. So if you want to pass multiple app-config
                  files, it is recommended to pass one ConfigMap/Secret per app-config
                  file.
